# A Beginner-Level COVID-19 Analysis featuring Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 Data 

This repository contains tidy data from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. This is my first project as a Master's student with CU Boulder, and this repository will also be using visuals learned in-class, like US COVID cases/deaths chronologically both by totals and by new cases/deaths calculated daily. Further, I personally analyzed the effects of population density and wealth inequality by county in my home state of California to practice the skills learned in class, and to settle my own curiosity. I chose to make this public in case any other student might need to reference in-class code, and to share ideas for subsequent analyses.
